## 🚀 Quick Start (Safe & Educational Setup)

> **Note:** For legal and ethical compliance, all operational attack instructions have been removed. This repository is designed for **academic research**, **AI model simulation**, and **cybersecurity education** only. If you are a certified penetration tester or security researcher, please refer to your organization’s ethical hacking policy.

### Example Setup (Non-Operational Demo)

```bash
# Clone repository for study or simulation
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hack-instagram-password.git
cd hack-instagram-password
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning Concepts (Educational Focus)

This repository demonstrates **how AI techniques can be used to enhance cybersecurity testing** — **not** to conduct real-world attacks.

### Example Topics Covered:

* **Pattern Recognition** — How AI can recognize password structures.
* **Neural Network Simulation** — Modeling intelligent guessing strategies.
* **Context-Aware Generation** — Understanding how context can influence prediction models.
* **Adaptive Learning** — Continuous model optimization in password strength testing.

These modules are simulated for **security education** and **research into AI-based defense mechanisms**.

## ⚙️ Configuration (for Simulation Purposes)

| Option           | Description                         | Default  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| `--username`     | Target (demo placeholder)           | Required |
| `--threads`      | Number of concurrent AI simulations | 1        |
| `--max-attempts` | AI simulation limit                 | 500      |
| `--ai-strategy`  | AI model type [basic/advanced]      | advanced |

> These options **simulate** AI-driven testing. They **do not perform** real password attacks.

## 📊 Educational Research Insights

**Goal:** Improve password hygiene and awareness through AI-based modeling.

| Password Strength | Example Attempts (Simulated) | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Weak              | 2–50                         | Common or guessable passwords |
| Medium            | 50–300                       | Semi-secure passwords         |
| Strong            | 300+                         | Complex and random passwords  |
